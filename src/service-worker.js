/* The build process involves Workbox grabbing this file, injecting the precacheManifest
attribute, and generating a modified service-worker.js in the dist directory.

I switched from the default "GenerateSW" strategy (which auto-generates the whole
service worker) to "InjectManifest" (which lets us define it here) to be able to
change the cache suffix. This was configured in vue.config.js. */

// Add a suffix so that the cache of a new worker doesn't overwrite an old one's.
// This matters because the new worker won't immediately become active.
